# Multi-objective-optimum-design-of-geometrically-non-linear-shallow-dome-structures
Matlab codes to reproduce the experiments presented in the article "Multi-objective optimum design of geometrically non-linear shallow dome structures", by João Marcos de Paula Vieira, José Pedro Gonçalves Carvalho, Dênis Emanuel da Costa Vargas, Érica da Costa Reis Carvalho, Patrícia Habib Hallak, and Afonso Celso de Castro Lemonge.

To solve the optimization problems, the user must execute the code "main_shamodes.m" for SHAMODE and SHAMODE-WO, and "MMIPDE.m" for the MM-IPDE. The user can also edit the parameters in these main codes (number of executions, generations, etc), and in the "dados_do_problema.m" file. The restrictions are presented in the "restricao.m" code, while the objective functions must be chosen in the "funcpop.m" code. The files include the program NUMA-TF, by Rangel (2019). They are divided according to the analyzed truss and the evolutionay algorithm.
